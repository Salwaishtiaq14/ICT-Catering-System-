# ICT-Catering-System-
A catering system triggering WPE , explaining in detail about stake holders, its assumptions , functional / non- functional requirements , use cases and Domain Class diagram. 
# Detail Requirments 
1. You need to Describe the trigger of the Weddings Parties Everything system (WPE) and explain
the benefit WPE would bring. Write in your own words and explain the reasons for
each.
2.  List the main stakeholders for the Weddings Parties Everything system (WPE). For
each stakeholder, describe their interest in the system and what aspects of it are of
particular relevance to them (You do not need to categorize the stakeholders. Donâ€™t
include the systems development team).
3. Make assumptions about where information in the case is incomplete and where
WPE can be improved around a given case. Discuss the proposed assumptions.
4.(a) List and briefly describe the main functional requirements for the WPE.
(b) List and briefly describe the main nonfunctional requirements for the WPE.
5.(a) Use the User Goal technique to develop a list of use cases for the WPE.
Present your list in a table that includes the participating actors, use case name
and brief use case description.
(b) Use the Event Decomposition technique to identify any additional use cases
for the WPE. These will probably be temporal and state event types. Present
your list in a table that includes the event, type of event, use case name, and
brief use case description. You do not need to repeat the use cases you
identified in (a) here.
6. Create a domain model class diagram for the WPE, including all classes, attributes,
associations, and multiplicity. Show association classes and generalisation
hierarchies where appropriate. Include related cases for the proposed assumptions
in the diagram and explain how it relates to other cases.
